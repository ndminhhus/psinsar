##Advanced processing of SAR interferometry time series using SNAP and StaMPS (Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers).
This document will describe in details all the steps and releated theory of the workflow.
Unlike others tutorial, this recipie will try to cover 99% of the process including installation, version fixing, upgrading, etc.
