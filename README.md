# Advanced processing of SAR interferometry time series using SNAP and StaMPS (Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers)
This document will describe in details all the steps and releated theory.

Unlike others tutorial, this recipie will try to cover 99% of the process including installation, version fixing, upgrading, etc. If you are a Windows 10 user, have no or very little experience with python, linux and want to do SAR interferometry time series analysis by the method of StaMPS (Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers). This document is for you.

My first advice is: You don't have to install every sofware/packages at onces. We only install a software/package when it is the barrier to prevent us from moving forward. In that way, you will understand what, why and when a certain action is needed. 

Day 1: Define study area and download SLC Sentinel 1
Day 2: Prepare input for StaMPS PSI
Day 3: Installation 
Day 4: Analysis with StaMPS PS
